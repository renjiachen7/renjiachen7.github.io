I am a student at the University of Utah, majoring in Entertainment Arts & Engineering (EAE) with a minor in Animation. Throughout my studies, I have developed my skills in 3D modeling and texturing using software such as Maya, ZBrush, Substance 3D Painter, and Photoshop. Additionally, my knowledge in sound and cinematography has enriched my understanding of game production, highlighting my comprehensive approach to game design.

I have maintained a GPA of 3.78, which reflects my dedication to academic excellence. I have gained experience by contributing to various game projects such as '[AUGMENT!](https://kaeyde.itch.io/augment)' and 'The Pied Piper', where I have worked on both 3D and 2D art, expanding my knowledge of the industry.

As I work towards my goal of becoming a successful game developer, my aim is to combine art and technology to create games that will have a universal appeal. My combination of technical and artistic skills makes me well-suited for innovative projects in digital design and animation. I am deeply passionate about gaming.
